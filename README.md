# Tracking the infodemic: Conspiracy theories in the corona crisis

This is the public repository of our project [Tracking the Infodemic](https://www.linguistik.phil.fau.de/projects/tracking-the-infodemic/), concerned with identifying conspiracy narratives in German text and tracing their distribution on social media, analysing typical linguistic patterns and discursive strategies, and much more.

Currently, you can only find a list of 63 fine-grained categories (including examples from Telegram) for annotation purposes here. We plan to add more data, scripts and analyses as our work continues.
