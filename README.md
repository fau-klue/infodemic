# Tracking the infodemic: Conspiracy theories in the corona crisis

This is the public repository of our project [Tracking the Infodemic](https://www.linguistik.phil.fau.de/projects/tracking-the-infodemic/), concerned with identifying conspiracy narratives in German text and tracing their distribution on social media, analysing typical linguistic patterns and discursive strategies, and much more.

In addition to our collected talks and presentations, you can find a list of 63 fine-grained categories (including examples from Telegram) for annotation purposes here. A [manually annotated sample](annotated_sample) is also available, split into training, development and test data.
